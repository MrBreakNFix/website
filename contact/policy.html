    <h1>Contact Policy</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Welcome! I am MrBreakNFix, and this policy outlines how I handle communications.</p>
    <p>Please review this document carefully before reaching out, particularly for formal or sensitive matters such as legal inquiries, security vulnerabilities, exploits, or other confidential issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This policy is not a legally binding contract. It is intended to provide an outline of my communication practices. Separate documentation will be required for any legally binding agreements.</p>

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Privacy as a Priority:</strong> I prioritize privacy by default. Any communication can be kept confidential upon explicit request. I will not share personal information without consent, except when required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>No Requests for Exploits or Duplication Glitches:</strong> I do not entertain requests for exploits, vulnerabilities, or duplication glitches. These are treated as confidential by default, and sharing such information may lead to them being patched or rendered obsolete.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="confidentiality">
  <h2>1. Confidentiality</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confidential Requests:</strong> If you require confidentiality, please explicitly request it at the start of the interaction. Once requested, your conversation will remain private and will only be disclosed if required by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Default Status:</strong> In the absence of a confidentiality request, I may reference or share communications unless I believe the information could be sensitive. For example, details about exploits or vulnerabilities shared with me will not be disclosed without your permission.</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="requests">
  <h2>2. Requests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Requests I Will Comply With:</strong>
      I will consider and respond to reasonable requests related to my work, projects, or areas of expertise. These may include technical inquiries, support for public projects, and general collaboration requests.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Requests I Will Not Comply With:</strong>
      I will not entertain requests for confidential information, including but not limited to exploits, vulnerabilities, or any request that violates privacy rights as outlined in this policy.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Exploits and Duplication Glitches:</strong>
      Requests related to exploits, vulnerabilities, or duplication glitches will generally not be complied with. These are treated as confidential by default, and I will not share any such information without the explicit consent of the person who discovered it. Additionally, I reserve the right to deny any such requests, especially because sharing them may lead to them being patched or rendered obsolete, which could compromise the value or integrity of the information.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Special Considerations:</strong>
      Requests involving sensitive or confidential matters will be handled with discretion. Any such request should be made clearly and explicitly if confidentiality is required.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="transparency">
  <h2>3. Transparency and Use of Communications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Public Discussions:</strong> Contributions made in non-confidential contexts may be shared publicly or used to improve projects, unless you specifically request otherwise.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribution:</strong> Any significant contributions will be publicly credited only with your explicit consent. I respect your preference for privacy and will honor any request to remain anonymous.</li>
  </ul>
</section>



<section id="interaction">
  <h2>4. Interaction Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respect and Professionalism:</strong> All communications should remain respectful, courteous, and professional. Any form of harassment, abuse, or inappropriate behavior will result in the immediate termination of the interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Enforcement of Boundaries:</strong> I reserve the right to disengage from or end any conversation that violates these guidelines, at my sole discretion.</li>
  </ul>
</section>


<section id="legal">
  <h2>5. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> All communications and interactions are subject to applicable local, national, and international laws. Any information shared with me may be disclosed if required by law through a valid legal process, such as a court-issued search warrant or subpoena.</li>
    <li><strong>Notification of Disclosure:</strong> Where legally permitted, I will make reasonable efforts to inform you before disclosing any information in response to legal requirements, unless prohibited by law or court order.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="legally-binding">
  <h2>6. Legally Binding Agreements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Formal Documentation:</strong> Any legally binding agreement must be established through a formal written contract, signed by all parties involved. Verbal or informal communication is not considered legally binding.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope of Policy:</strong> This contact policy is not a legally binding document. It is provided solely to outline my general practices and expectations for communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Involvement:</strong> For legal matters requiring third-party verification or involvement, such as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or contracts, please contact me in advance to arrange the necessary documentation.</li>
  </ul>
