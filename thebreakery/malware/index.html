    <h1>Malware Analysis Submission</h1>
    <p>Would you like me to analyze a piece of malware you found?</p>
    <p>If you upload it here, and it looks interesting, I'll take a look at it.</p>
    <br>

    <form id="uploadForm">
        <div class="window">
            <label for="fileInput">Upload your malware sample:</label>

            <div class="custom-file-upload">
                <input type="file" id="fileInput" name="file">
                <button type="button" id="uploadButton">Choose File</button>

        <label for="emailInput">Your email address:</label>
        <input type="email" id="emailInput" name="email">
        <p class="hint">This is so I can contact you for more information if needed, and for the results of the analysis. As soon as you submit, you will receive a single automated email of a fully automatic analysis before the full results are sent. Your email will not be sold or spammed.</p>

        <label for="commentsInput">Any comments or notes?</label>
        <textarea id="commentsInput" name="comments"></textarea>
        <p class="hint">Please include things like where you found the malware, what you think it does, and any other information that might be helpful. For example a good report would include the URL where you found the malware, or even imgur links to screenshots.</p>
